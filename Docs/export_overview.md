### Export


Most services do not provide free or standard export options.  
- **MAL**: Has a built-in export feature (standard format).  
- **AniList**: No direct export feature — you would need third-party tools.  
- **Simkl**: Export is available, but only for premium subscribers.  

To solve this, Zoro provides its own **Export Feature** for all supported APIs.  Go to **Settings → Data → Export**

**What the Export Feature does**
- Exports your full data into two formats:  
  1. **Complete CSV Export** – Contains all your data with no loss of information.  
  2. **Standard Format Export** – A commonly supported format for migrating to other platforms.  

**Export Formats**
- **Anime & Manga**:  
  - CSV (full data, no loss)  
  - XML (MAL-compatible standard format, may have some limitations)  
- **TV & Movies**:  
  - CSV (full data, no loss)  
  - IMDb-formatted CSV (importable on websites that support IMDb lists, but with some data loss/limitations)  

>  Standard formats (like XML or IMDb CSV) may have restrictions and do not include every data field.  For details on these limitations, see the [Export Guide](https://github.com/zara-kasi/zoro/blob/main/Docs%2Fexport-doc.md).
