## Edit Feature

The **Edit** feature allows you to update your list entries directly from Obsidian. Changes are sent to the connected API (AniList, MAL, Simkl) and applied to your account.

### Supported actions
- **Status** – Set an item as `CURRENT`, `COMPLETED`, `PAUSED`, `DROPPED`, or `PLANNING`.
- **Progress** – Update the number of episodes/chapters finished.
- **Rating** – Assign or change a personal score.
- **Favorite** – Mark or unmark an item as a favorite.
- **Remove** – Delete the entry from your list.
