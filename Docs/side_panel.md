The **Side Panel** is your main hub for managing media inside Obsidian.  
Open it from the **align-right** icon on any media card.

The panel offers four actions: **Create Note**, **Connect Note**, **Edit**, and **Details**.

## 1. Create Note
>*Use this when you want to make a brand-new note for a media item.*  

- Creates a new note in your configured folder (`Settings → Zoro → Note path`).  
- Adds extended frontmatter with:
  - `title` and alternate titles
  - `media_type` (ANIME | MANGA | MOVIE | TV)
  - IDs (`mal_id`, `anilist_id`, `simkl_id`, etc.)
  - `progress`, `rating`, `favorite`
  - `cover` (image link)
  - `url` (canonical links to the media)  
- File is named with a clean title.
- Can also auto-insert a **media block** if enabled.

## 2. Connect Note
>*Use this when you already have a note for the media and want to link it with Zoro.*  

- Opens a search bar to select a note from your vault.  
- On connect, Zoro updates the note with the same extended frontmatter as **Create Note** (title, IDs, cover, rating, etc.).

## 3. Edit
>*Use this when you want to update your list entry without leaving Obsidian.*  

- Opens an edit menu for the selected media.  
- You can change and sync values directly with your connected API (AniList, MAL, Simkl):
  - **Status** (CURRENT, COMPLETED, PAUSED, DROPPED, PLANNING)
  - **Progress** (episodes/chapters)
  - **Rating**
  - **Favorite toggle**  
- All edits are applied instantly to your online list.
