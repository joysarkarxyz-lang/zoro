### Shortcuts


This feature lets you add your own website URLs to the **More Details Panel → External Links** section.  
It’s useful for quickly searching an item’s title (e.g., English title) on any website you prefer.  

**How it works** 
- The plugin uses the website’s search URL and automatically inserts the item’s title into it.  
- When clicked, the link redirects you to that website’s search results for the selected item.  

**How to use it**
1. Go to the website where you want to search (e.g., a review site, wiki, or streaming service).  
2. Perform a search manually for anything.  
3. Copy the **search URL** from your browser’s address bar.  
4. Paste that URL into the **shortcut section** for the correct media type (Anime, Manga, TV, or Movie).  
5. Once saved, the plugin will generate a working link in the **External Links** section of the details panel.  

This way, you can instantly search any item on your favorite websites with one click.

> If the search URL you added **doesn’t work**, it means that website’s search format isn’t directly compatible with the plugin. In that case, you can still make it work by following the [guide](https://github.com/zara-kasi/zoro/blob/main/Docs%2Fcustom-external-search-urls.md).
